## What is this repository?

This is an open-source repository with flashcards about Emacs. The flashcard deck here is, basically, an [org-mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode) file (`.org`) with special annotations. 

Org mode files have plain text style with a **simple mark-up** which means you can comfortably read the source. However, In order to have the file really behaving like a flashcard system, you need to use [org-drill](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html) - which is another package from Emacs.

## Why doing this?

Emacs is **tough** to learn. Period. However, Emacs is also **awesome** :)

I have been using Emacs almost daily for the last five months and I still keep learning (loads of) new stuff every week. Moreover, I keep learning how to improve my old _habits_ and _workflow_. As you probanly know, in Emacs, there are always many ways of achieve the same end goal in Emacs, but one of them (or a few of them) tend to be the faster, more comfortable or more elegant. Especially because you change change Emacs, tinkering it to be tailor-made for yourself.

Keybindings is a especial topic. There are many _combos_ to learn and get used to. Thus, I think a flashcard tool with spaced repetition approach could be a great help to improve the memory. Finally, there is nothing more organic Emacs hacking than using a spaced repetition software program inside Emacs (org-dril) to improve the learning process about Emacs!


## Limitations

Becoming an Emacs power user is hard challenge covering different dimensions. For instance, Elisp (Emacs lisp) would need to be mastered. This repository does not help with stuff like Elisp hacking and customization. It is especially useful for memorization of the main commands and keybindings.

## How to use it?

## Who is this for?

Honestly, this is made by me for me. But maybe it is going to be useful for other people too! If someone had done such a thing, I would definetly use it to improve my Emacs skills. It will also serve as my notes about Emacs.

### More material

Over the last few months, I have come across great material about Emacs. Actually, Emacs itself helps a lot with the `describe`, `info-mode`, and `apropos`. In case you want to check out other resources, there are the ones I like the most:

- If you are really new to Emacs, check-out the tutorial (execute `M-x help-with-tutorial`);
- The book [Mastering Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org/) is awesome;
- Youtube videos from [System Crafters](https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemCrafters) are great, especialy the playlists: [Emacs from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74zOY-vgkyw&list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ) and [The Absolute Begginer Guide to Emacs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48JlgiBpw_I&list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPZvSdewHG8uApD7THlLLCV);
- This [Anki card](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2000749682) about Emacs seems to be well-reviewed. Unfortunately, I do not have the money to pay for Anki. It could be another good resource material if you have the cas$h. 

### Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If I happen to really use this repo consistently adding new content to it and using it for trainning, it would already be an utter success. If other people start using it, making contributions, and adding even more content about Emacs it would be supreme. Feel free to send a patch :)
